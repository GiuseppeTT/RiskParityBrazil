## Dashboards
Dashboards:

```{r dashboards, results = "asis"}
pack_config <-
    here::here("config/pack.yaml") %>%
    yaml::read_yaml()

dashboard_names <-
    pack_config %>%
    purrr::map_chr("name")

base_url <- "https://giuseppett.github.io/RiskParityBrazil/dashboard/"

dashboard_names %>%
    purrr::walk(~ cat(glue::glue("- [{.x}]({base_url}{RiskParityBrazil::name_dashboard_file(.x)})\n\n")))
```

## Details
Details:

- The risk parity portfolios are built using one-year rolling volatilities and are rebalanced yearly.
- The smooth plots use an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) with a smoothing parameter equivalent to a halflife of one month.
- One should be careful before drawing conclusions due to the sample size. Although 20 years may seem like a lot, this period was characterized by a descrese in the interest rates, which pumps up bond returns.
